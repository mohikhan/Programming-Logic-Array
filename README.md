# Programming-Logic-Array
This project was my institute technical project

I have implemented Programmic Logic Array into C++ code from scratch to properly implement various kinds of combinational logic circuits and devised an algorithm for solving the Quineâ€“McCluskey method for the minimization of Boolean functions
